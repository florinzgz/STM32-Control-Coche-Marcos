# ESP32-S3 HMI — Include Directory

This directory contains C++ header files for the ESP32-S3 HMI firmware.

All CAN message IDs and payload definitions are mirrored from
`docs/CAN_CONTRACT_FINAL.md` rev 1.0. They are **not** imported from the
STM32 `Core/Inc/` headers.

See `docs/ESP32_FIRMWARE_DESIGN.md` for the full architecture description.
